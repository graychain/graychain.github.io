</p>
<p>As we approach the tenth year of Ethereum’s conception, the EVM has transcended its reference blockchain. The EVM is now used on dozens of blockchains to settle billions of dollars worth of value. The EVM is a common language akin to Javascript or TCP/IP. It is the language of value, a convention of shared state.</p>
<p>It is time to bring the EVM home to Urbit. It’s time to augment it for the next hundred million users. It’s time to launch the Urbit Virtual Machine.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-urbit-virtual-machine">What is the Urbit Virtual Machine?</h1>
<p>Put simply, the Urbit Virtual Machine is an L1 EVM network running natively on Urbit.</p>
<p>The Urbit Virtual Machine (UVM) is a superset of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), running natively on Urbit instances. It maintains EVM equivalence with the option to add Urbit native opcodes.</p>
<p>Why an Urbit EVM?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A self sovereign, Urbit native blockchain, without external dependencies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of the Urbit ID as an ideal seed for the network. Every. Urbit. ship. is pre-funded with <strong>$U</strong>, and pre-configured to interact with the UVM. Sending value to someone is as easy as typing in their ship name</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A shared value layer for high value state, to enhance the Urbit developer canvas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A token supply owned by the Urbit community, with validators acting in defense of Urbit principles</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interoperability with defi primitives and liquidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opportunity to eclipse Ethereum in validator count, due to Urbit’s ease of use</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ability to merge novel future primitives, such as zkEVM or sharding</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Secondary Benefits</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A native client to interact with Azimuth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unifying the fragmented L1 &amp; L2 PKI</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A native client for Ethereum, EVM compatible L1s, &amp; Rollups  </p><p align="center"></p>

<h1 id="u">$U</h1>
<p align="center"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/mY0zEWx.png" alt="$U Citadel" width="250"></p>
<p><strong>$U</strong> is a universal constant. You can feel it in your essence.</p>
<p><strong>$U</strong> is the unit of account for the UVM blockchain.  There will only ever be 24 single character ticker symbols. UVM merits ownership of this extremely scarce real estate.</p>
<p><strong>$U</strong> is Urbit’s value layer, the fungible sinew between Urbit applications</p>
<p>If one encounters tooling that requires a multi-character ticker symbol, the colloquial ticker given shall be <strong>$URBT</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="token-supply">Token Supply</h1>
<p>80% of the liquid <strong>$U</strong> supply has been granted to the Urbit community.</p>

<h4 id="airdrop-allocations">Airdrop allocations:</h4>
<h5 id="peripheral-addresses">Peripheral Addresses:</h5>
<p>Every address that appeared in the PKI received <strong>283 $U</strong>  That includes transfer proxies, spawn proxies, voting proxies, and management proxies.</p>
<h4 id="l2-ship-owners">L2 Ship Owners</h4>
<p>Every L2 ship owner address received <strong>921 $U</strong></p>

<p>Every active running ship received <strong>145,195 $U</strong></p>
<p>(Active ship snapshot was performed July 20th, 2022)</p>
<h4 id="ethereum-addresses">Ethereum Addresses</h4>
<p>Additionally, 4,509,613 Ethereum addresses received <strong>0.1 $U</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>408,823 addresses that own a .eth domain,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>500,103 addresses that interacted with a bridge contract</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3,600,687 addresses holding &gt; 1.005 ETH</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An additional, illiquid, 500mm <strong>$U</strong> have been locked as a war-chest for protocol development, incentive programs, future airdrops, or to be burned in it’s entirety.</p>
<hr>
<p>Your airdrop can be seed funding for contribution to the UVM, or something else in Urbit. <strong>$U</strong> is is seed funding for the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Holding your airdrop for lucrative validator opportunities is recommended.</p>
<h1 id="the-case-for-u">The Case For $U</h1>
<p><em>As Urbit displaces all of computing, people will come home to Urbit’s own blockchain</em></p>
<p>Ethereum is presently a $200 Billion dollar protocol. UVM will surpass it through superior decentralization, and superior UX.</p>
<p>Today’s “Ethereum killers” compromise on decentralization to lower gas fees. But one look at their respective market caps shows that the capital allocators value secure, decentralized blockchains above all else.</p>
<p>Urbit’s breakthrough ability to allow users to easily run server side software will drastically increase node count which will allow increased state capacity through sharding. Developers and investors will assign blue chip status to the UVM.</p>
<h5 id="crypto-has-a-decentralization-problem">Crypto has a decentralization problem</h5>
<blockquote>
<p>“A lie is sweet in the beginning and bitter in the end, and truth is bitter in the beginning, and sweet in the end.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The most decentralized major smart contract protocol: Ethereum, has active censorship on a substantial, if not a majority, of it’s infrastructure: Ethermine, USDC, Infura, &amp; Alchemy, are presently censoring transactions from specific contracts and addresses.</p>
<p>60% of staked PoS Ethereum is currently sitting with four vulnerable entities: Lido (30%), Coinbase (15%), Kraken (8%), and Binance (7%). These entities are vulnerable to censorship pressures, if greater than 50% of staked eth refuses censored transactions, they cannot be included in the chain.</p>
<p>Any protocol that is technically able to discriminate against transactions, inevitably will do so. Said protocol will descend into a virtue spiral, where every transaction is subject to filtration or worse.</p>
<h5 id="decentralization-is-an-opportunity">Decentralization is an opportunity</h5>
<p>Urbit’s UX enables every user to easily run their own validator. This fixes the user’s incentive to delegate tokens to centralized validation pools, as validation is simple and baked in to the Urbit OS.</p>
<p>Urbit is disrupting the command line.</p>
<p>Additionally, the ability to quickly merge new zkEVM research, will prevent validators from seeing transaction content, thus preventing transaction descrimination. An L1 who’s transactions are not visible to validators and infrastructure providers will attract the most capital.</p>
<h5 id="urbit-users-are-already-in-the-citadel">Urbit users are already in the Citadel</h5>
<p>UVM ownership has been seeded to the most forward looking, technically gifted community members in the crypto ecosystem. Throughout history technical early adopters have been leading indicators of wealth, a trend that will benefit UVM.</p>
<h5 id="every-ship-is-a-uvm-user">Every ship is a UVM user</h5>
<p>With the PKI (Urbit IDs), every user is automatically able to receive tokens and other UVM state. There is no onboarding friction.</p>
<h5 id="the-uvm-unifies-l1-and-l2-address-space">The UVM unifies L1 and L2 address space</h5>
<p>Private keys used for ship administration on L2 and L1 are both equally valid on the UVM. This saves the PKI from a deeply hindering fragmentation.</p>
<h5 id="validator-ux--superior-validator-count">Validator UX = superior validator count</h5>
<p>Four click validator install increases the validator count, which increases decentralization &amp; security, which increases state capacity in a sharding scenario. Node count is the hidden factor in solving the blockchain trilemma.</p>
<h5 id="u---pki-flywheel">$U &lt;-&gt; PKI Flywheel</h5>
<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/OwWo6tW.png" alt="Flywheel" width="375">
</p>
<p><strong>U</strong> Will attract EVM users, which will increase the demand for ship ownership, which will in turn, increase the interest in <strong>$U</strong>, and so on, and so forth. Users will come for the yields, and stay for the beauty of the Urbit application ecosystem.</p>
<h5 id="the-accretive-full-stack-blockchain--os">1 + 1 = 3, The accretive full stack: blockchain + OS</h5>
<p>The dream stack: most blockchains can only dream of having a clean slate OS to pair with their state chain.</p>
<h5 id="application-driven-demand">Application driven demand</h5>
<p>Urbit application development will increase transaction volume and demand for <strong>$U</strong>.</p>
<h5 id="evm-equivalence-accelerates-development">EVM Equivalence accelerates development</h5>
<p>EVM equivalence allows the use of familiar, audited, lindy contracts on the UVM.</p>
<p>Urbit native DEX, Money market, Stablecoins, NFT Marketplaces will increase demand for <strong>$U</strong>. Native Urbit integration will improve the UX, and reduce frontend UI censorship risk.</p>
<h5 id="community">Community</h5>
<p>Only the Urbit community has the technical chops, and the culture of censorship resistance to incubate the people’s EVM.</p>
<h5 id="airdrop---validators">Airdrop -&gt; Validators</h5>
<p>With 80% of the liquid supply of <strong>$U</strong> allocated to the Urbit community, and the remaining allocated for development and services, the $<strong>U</strong> validator citadel will be composed of the most forward thinking, technically literate, and pro civil liberty community members in crypto. Such a citadel is essential during the technical transition from a censorship resistant, to a censorship proof protocol.</p>
<h5 id="validator-yield">Validator yield</h5>
<p>Ease of validation creates demand for $<strong>U</strong> and reduces selling pressure, as stakers need to buy $<strong>U</strong> to access APR yield.</p>
<h5 id="deep-integration">Deep integration</h5>
<p>As Urbit disrupts all of computing, the ability to add Urbit specific opcodes will increase the UVM’s moat against other blockchains. Protocols will come home to <strong>$U</strong> to do things other blockchains just can’t do.</p>
<h5 id="multichain-future">Multichain future</h5>
<p>Ethereum maintaining a reasonable amount of state for decentralization is understandable. However, this necessitates a cap on the amount of activity the network can support.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/peter_szilagyi/status/1563051603846115328?s=20&amp;t=KfpX0FoQY8TeeAvdPHIXCQ">As Ethereum core developers discuss state rent/pruning</a>, it is a certainty that the global demand for shared state will exceed the single hard drive’s worth of storage on the EVM. Thus a multi chain future is ensured.</p>
<p>Winner takes most dynamics don’t apply when growth is intentionally constrained, a dynamic that will benefit the UVM.</p>
<h1 id="claim-flow">Claim Flow</h1>
<p>Your tokens are already deposited to the Urbit PKI, no “claim” is required. You can access and use your <strong>$U</strong> using the same keys that control your Urbit ship.  UVM is compatible with all Ethereum infrastructure and can be used with your favorite wallet/tooling.</p>
<h5 id="allocation-recap">Allocation Recap:</h5>
<ul>
<li>

<h4 id="technical-roadmap">Technical Roadmap</h4>
<p>UVM began life with Clique consensus. In the near future the network will migrate to proof of stake. As consensus development proceeds, a minority Hoon client will begin operating and begin and begin to establish lindyness. The targeted validation share of the network will increase as the primary Hoon validation client matures. Development of a second and third client will further diversify the validation network and allow Urbit native validator nodes to take the majority of the network.</p>
<p>The execution layer will follow a similar path.</p>
<p>As the benefits of the Urbit stack become more well known, we expect a material percentage of Ethereum mainnet validation to be performed by Urbit native nodes.</p>
<h5 id="design-ethos">Design Ethos</h5>
<p><strong>$U</strong> is the decentralization maximalist EVM network. Whenever centralization risks are identified: funded, concerted, and preemptive architectures will be developed &amp; implemented. $U will not be decentralized by crises, $U will be decentralized by design.</p>
<h1 id="roadmap-and-bounties">Roadmap and Bounties</h1>
<p>UVM has allocated a percentage of the genesis supply of <strong>$U</strong> to the UVM Roadmap.</p>
<p>There will be a general second airdrop in the future, for general participants, contributors, and efforts that don’t fall into these categories.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>An Urbit sovereign network is the only way to eliminate external censorship risks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If UVM validators detect censorship, they have a moral responsibility to slash the offending nodes immediately, or fork the network if slashing is insufficient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The network should prepare against centralization vectors preemptively</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As Urbit approaches it’s J curve of growth and it’s eternal September, now is the time to take a cultural snapshot and leverage the Urbit ethos to create an EVM that safeguards users.</p>
